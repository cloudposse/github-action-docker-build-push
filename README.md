Build Docker image and push it




## Introduction

Build Docker image and push it. 




## Usage

```yaml
  name: Push into main branch
  on:
    push:
      branches: [ master ]

  jobs:
    context:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Build
        id: build
        uses: cloudposse/github-action-docker-build-push@main
        with:
          registry: registry.hub.docker.com
          organization: "${{ github.event.repository.owner.login }}"
          repository: "${{ github.event.repository.name }}"
          login: "${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}"
          password: "${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}"
          platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64

    outputs:
      image: ${{ steps.build.outputs.image }}
      tag: ${{ steps.build.outputs.tag }}
```
> [!TIP]
> If omitted, `cache-from` and `cache-to` will default to `gha`.
> In an AWS environment, we recommend using [ECR as a remote cache](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/announcing-remote-cache-support-in-amazon-ecr-for-buildkit-clients/).

We use [Atmos](https://atmos.tools) to streamline how Terraform tests are run. It centralizes configuration and wraps common test workflows with easy-to-use commands.

All tests are located in the [`test/`](test) folder.

Under the hood, tests are powered by Terratest together with our internal [Test Helpers](https://github.com/cloudposse/test-helpers) library, providing robust infrastructure validation.

Setup dependencies:
- Install Atmos ([installation guide](https://atmos.tools/install/))
- Install Go [1.24+ or newer](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- Install Terraform or OpenTofu

To run tests:

- Run all tests:  
  ```sh
  atmos test run
  ```
- Clean up test artifacts:  
  ```sh
  atmos test clean
  ```
- Explore additional test options:  
  ```sh
  atmos test --help
  ```
The configuration for test commands is centrally managed. To review what's being imported, see the [`atmos.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/.github/refs/heads/main/.github/atmos/terraform-module.yaml) file.

Learn more about our [automated testing in our documentation](https://docs.cloudposse.com/community/contribute/automated-testing/) or implementing [custom commands](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/custom-commands/) with atmos.
